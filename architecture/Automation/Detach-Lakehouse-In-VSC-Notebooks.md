To ensure your `.ipynb` notebooks in Visual Studio Code are **not attached to any lakehouse**:

- Open the notebook in VS Code.
- At the top right (or top bar), look for the "Lakehouse" or "Data" connection indicator.
- Click it and select "Detach" or "Disconnect" (the wording may vary).
- If you see a "Select Lakehouse" prompt, choose "None" or "Cancel".
