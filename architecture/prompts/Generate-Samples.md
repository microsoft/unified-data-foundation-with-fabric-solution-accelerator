## Generate Samples - Product and ProductCategory 

I am back to sample data generation tasks. 

​	I am sharing the semantic model file named `Model_Shared_Data.ipynb` which has semantic model for Customer and Product 	Domain. Let me know if you see this file. **Yes received.** 

​        I have created a new Notebook `Generate_ProductCategory_Samples1.ipyn.`  Let me know if you see this file. **Yes received.** 

​	I am also sharing Generate_Product_Samples.ipynb which I used before. This is a reference file only. Do you see this file? 

**Great!** 

I have successfully generated all the tables for Customer Domain. I have also generated sample data for Product Table.

The results is stored in C:\temp\samples\output_as_input\Product_Samples.csv. We will use the values from the columns 

- CategoryID
- CategoryName

Of course there are duplicates in the Product_Samples.csv file, you will only pick the unique values of CategoryID and CategoryName for each record. For ParentCategoryId, we will fill in the value of "1" for now. 

For BrandName, you can fill in empty string for now. 

For IsActive, you will fill in 'True' for all

for BrandLogoUrl, fill in the text 'TBD' for all.

For CategoryDescription, you can fill in "Contoso Cool Things" for all.

We will product the output file with name and location here:  C:\temp\samples\output_as_input\ProductCategory_Samples1.csv.

Now we need to fill in the code in `Generate_ProductCategory_Samples1.ipynb` to get what we need 

**Let me know if you understand my requests.** 

## Generate Additional Samples - Product and ProductCategory for ADB

**Good day! Are you ready for some creative work?** 

I have data models stored in file `Model_Shared_Data.ipynb,` which has table schema for Product and ProductCategory. I have generated one set sample data and stored in these files based on the table schemas 

- C:\temp\samples\output_as_input\Product_Samples _Fabric.csv
- C:\temp\samples\output_as_input\ProductCategory_Samples _Fabric.csv

I need to generate sample data for another sales channel, lets call it 'ADB' for now. We will use same schema but we can generate products for Family or business kitchens, such as coffee maker, forks, knifes, coffee cups, serving dishes, ice cream dishes, all sorts of things you can think of for the kitchen. We can use "Contoso Kitchen" for BrandName. For ParentCategoryId Field, we will use Parent_2 for now. For CategoryID, we will use digits greater than 200, +1 increment. 

You can use the above existing samples as reference and use your knowldge to complete the Product and ProductCategory sample generation. 

The code will be generated for the notebook named **Generate_Product_and_ProductCategory_Samples_ADB.ipynb**

The code will generate sample data for Product Table and ProductCategory table and output will be stored in

C:\temp\samples\output\Product_Samples _ADB.csv

C:\temp\samples\output\ProductCategory_Samples _ADB.csv

**I am sharing all the input files you need. Let me know what files you see.**

Great. Looks like you have all the info you need. Lets code! Thanks

**I reviewed the sample data generated. The ProductCategory sample is great. Great job! We can improve this a little on the Product data. here is I need:** 

- ProductStatus, make it all "active"

- StandardCost should be less than ListPrice

- CreatedDate: lets use one date, 1/10/2018 

- SellStartDate: lets use one data 3/1/2018 


## Generate Sales data for Fabric Channel 

I have a big task that can use your intelligence! Hope you are excited! 

I have generated sample data for shared domain, 5 tables in customer domain, 2 in Product Domain. You can see the model in Model_Shared_Data.ipynb. I need to generate sample data for Sales domain with 3 tables. You can see the model in the notebook named Model_Sales_Domain.ipynb.

I have shared these two files with you. Let me know if you can see these files.

I just created a notebook for us to write code. Generate_Sales_Data_Fabric.ipynb. Let me know if you can see it.

Please be a little patient as we work through this. I will give you as much input as possible here so you get the full picture.

My Input files are stored in my local machine: 

- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\Customer_Samples.csv: Store sample data for Customer Table
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\CustomerAccount_Samples.csv: Store sample data for CustomerAccount table
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\Product_Samples_Fabric.csv: Store sample data for Product Table that is only available for Fabric Sales Channel 
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\ProductCategory_Samples _Fabric.csv:  Store sample data for Table ProductCategory (for Fabric Sales Channel)
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\Location_Samples _Fabric.csv:  Store sample data for Table Location 
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\CustomerRelationshipType_Samples.csv:  Store sample data for Table CustomerRelationshipType
- C:\temp\samples\order_generation_input\CustomerTradeName_Samples.csv:  Store sample data for Table CustomerTradeName

**We may not need all the data or need more data. we will adjust as we go.**

We are going to be more intelligent when we generate sample sales data. We may need to work multiple iterations before we are happy. This will be a bit of fun journey. I will give you my initial thinking and you can add to your ideas before start. 

Sales Order Intelligence (Initial Draft - will be adjusted)

- We will generate orders for Fabric Channel only this time (We will do another set for ADB channel later, similar)
- We will generate orders with dates from Jan 1, 2019 to June 30, 2025. That gives us 5.5 years of data for good sales analysys
- Customer Sample: The CustomerTypeId and CustomerRelationshipTypeId in the Customer Sample give you what types of customer, and what segment, with definition in samples for Table CustomerRelationshipType.
- CustomerAccount Sample data: This one has Customer and Account Mapping. For Fabric Customer, each customer will have a CustomerAccountId (unique), Value of CustomerAccountName will be Fabric. 
- For OrderPayment Sample Data, we can randomly use VISA, MC, Discover, Paypal as PaymentMethod. We will generate an UUID for TransactionId

For Customer as Individual, the order amount and order frequency will be based on their tier: Standard places orders here and there, Premium will order more, and VIP customer are big spenders. Similar logic can be  applied to Government and Business Customer based on their segments. 

Yes you can pick date of order randomly, and products, too. We will need to create samples output files for three tables. and Store them in folder C:\temp\samples\order_generation_output  with below files:

- OrderLine_Samples_Fabric.csv
- Order_Samples_Fabric.csv 
- OrderPayment_Fabric.csv 



## Copilot Response 

Thank you for the detailed requirements and your initial draft. Here’s a summary and some additional suggestions before we start coding:

###### Your Initial Plan (Summary)

- **Input:** Use your provided sample CSVs for Customer, CustomerAccount, Product, ProductCategory, Location, etc.

- **Scope:** Generate sales data for the Fabric channel only (for now).

- **Date Range:** Orders from Jan 1, 2019 to June 30, 2025.

- **Customer Segmentation:** Use CustomerTypeId and CustomerRelationshipTypeId to drive order frequency and amount (e.g., VIPs order more, Standard less).

- **OrderPayment:** Randomly assign VISA, MC, Discover, PayPal; generate UUID for TransactionId.

- Output:

  Write three CSVs to

  ```
  C:\temp\samples\order_generation_output\
  ```

  - `OrderLine_Samples_Fabric.csv`
  - `Order_Samples_Fabric.csv`
  - `OrderPayment_Fabric.csv`

###### Additional Suggestions

1. **Order Generation Logic:**
   - Use customer segmentation to drive both order frequency (how many orders per year) and order size (number of lines, total value).
   - For each order, randomly select a CustomerAccountId that matches the CustomerId.
   - Assign a random order date within the specified range.
2. **OrderLine Generation:**
   - For each order, randomly select 1–5 products from the Fabric product sample.
   - Assign realistic quantities (e.g., 1–10).
   - Use the product’s ListPrice as UnitPrice, optionally add random discounts.
   - Calculate LineTotal and TaxAmount (5% tax).
3. **Order Table:**
   - Aggregate OrderLines to compute SubTotal, TaxAmount, and OrderTotal.
   - Assign a unique OrderId (UUID or sequential).
   - Assign OrderStatus (e.g., Completed, Pending, Cancelled) based on probabilities.
4. **OrderPayment Table:**
   - For each order, assign a payment method and generate a TransactionId (UUID).
5. **Data Consistency:**
   - Ensure all foreign keys (CustomerId, ProductId, CustomerAccountId) exist in the referenced sample tables.
   - Use only Fabric channel products and accounts.
6. **Output:**
   - Save all three tables as CSVs in the specified output folder.
