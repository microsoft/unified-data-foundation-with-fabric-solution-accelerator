**Prompt from Gaiye**

I have a new idea, lets not do any code yet. Lets create a new README.md file to capture the design first. 

We will build the architecture on top of what is described in README_Azure_O2C.md and README_Business_Process_Azure.md. We build an architecture like this: 

(1) Azure Databricks is another data source, having customer, product, and order. The formats are somewhat different that we need to map into our model described in Model_Shared_Data.ipynb, Model_Sales_Domain.ipynb, Model_Finance_Domain.ipynb. 

(2) We have data source from another sales channel saved as as .csv files that already exists in a Lakehouse in Azure Fabric (Bronze Tier? We can have a notebook to load the Files into Lakehouse Tables. Maybe we can make a shortcut to Azure DataBricks from this lake. 

(3) We have a process that loads various source data (Fabric Lakehouse Source Files, and Azure Databricks Source Data into Silver Tier Data Lake where our Designed Data Models have been created with the schemes stored in Model_Shared_Data.ipynb, Model_Sales_Domain.ipynb, and Model_Finance_Domain.ipynb. 

(4) We will have a process to cleanse and validate all the data in Silver Tier. Once Ready, the data is copied over to Gold Tier for analysis. The Gold Tier Data Model is probably more comprehensive than the Silver Tier. For now we may just use same as a starter and later perfect the gold tier. The gold tier may need to add some measurements, etc, to prepare the data for direct business use without a lot of additional processing. 

This is initial idea that we can discuss and explore and refine before finalizing it. 

I have all the files mentioned open in VSC so you can read the contents and then write into the README.md file which is empty right now. I request you to create draft that can be used for communication to the team, with diagram if needed. 

**Response from GitHub Copilot** 

Looking at your design concept, I'll create a comprehensive README that captures your multi-tier architecture with data sources from Azure Databricks and Fabric Lakehouse. Let me create this as a communication document for your team.
