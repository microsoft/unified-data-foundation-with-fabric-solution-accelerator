I have schema in sales domain defined by schema in this file: Model_Sales_Domain.ipynb

I have populated all the tables with sample data, sales from Jan 1, 2019 to June 30, 2025.

Now I'd like to ask you to write a note book to get the top selling products by total sales for each year, 2019-2024. 

We can use the data in orderline table. 

I have create this notebook for you to write code: Top_Selling_Products.ipynb. I have added code where you can get data from the lakehouse, defined in SOURCE_LAKEHOUSE_NAME.

**Do you see the two files I mentioned?**  (Yes) 

I need to get the top 5 selling products (use product Name) for each year, from 2019 to 2024. And them make a graphics about this results. 

Can you write the code to get the data and also display graphics?
