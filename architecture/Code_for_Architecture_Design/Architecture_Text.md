Unified Data Foundation Architecture Overview
Unified Data Foundation with Fabric Solution Accelerator provides an integrated architecture leveraging Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks to deliver a robust, governed analytics platform. Built on medallion architecture principles and supporting data mesh concepts, this accelerator unifies shared domain schemas for customer, product, finance, and sales data across multiple channels into a gold-tier lakehouse. The solution seamlessly integrates sales channel data hosted in Azure Databricks, utilizing Fabric Shortcut to bring this data into the gold tier for unified analytics and reporting. Pre-built Power BI dashboards showcase advanced sales analytics, while data governance is powered by Microsoft Purview, ensuring compliance and transparency.

This solution accelerator demonstrates how organizations can unify, govern, and analyze data across multiple domains and platforms using modern lakehouse architecture and robust governance, enabling rapid development of analytics solutions for diverse business needs.


The solution leverages Microsoft Fabric, Azure Databricks, and Power BI for unified analytics, with data stored and processed in lakehouse architecture using Delta tables. Integration between Fabric and Databricks is enabled via Fabric Shortcut, allowing seamless access to sales channel data in Azure Databricks. Data governance and cataloging across the platform are managed through Microsoft Purview, while OneLake and Azure SQL Database provide scalable storage and support transactional workloads.

The following diagram illustrates the core data flow and integration points of the Unified Data Foundation solution accelerator. Data lands in the Bronze Data Lake (OneLake), is processed through Silver and Gold lakehouse tiers, and is integrated with Azure Databricks for sales channel data. Power BI and Microsoft Purview provide analytics and governance across the platform.
