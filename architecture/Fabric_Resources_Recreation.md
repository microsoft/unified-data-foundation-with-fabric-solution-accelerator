## Export and Import Fabric Resource (from current Workspace to a new one)

To automate moving notebooks and pipelines to another Fabric workspace, you should:

1. **Export assets from your current workspace:**
   - In Fabric, you can export notebooks and pipelines as `.zip` or `.json` files.
   - For notebooks: Download/export each notebook file.
   - For pipelines: Use the export option in the pipeline UI to save the pipeline definition.
2. **Import assets into the new workspace:**  (This could also be automated with Python SDK and API Code)
   - In the target Fabric workspace, use the import/upload option to add notebooks and pipelines.
   - For notebooks: Upload the notebook files.
   - For pipelines: Import the pipeline definition file.
3. **Re-attach notebooks to lakehouses and update pipeline settings:** (This could also be automated with Python SDK and API Code)
   - After import, manually attach notebooks to the correct lakehouse in the new workspace.
   - Update any workspace-specific parameters in your pipeline activities.
