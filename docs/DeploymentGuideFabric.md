# Microsoft Fabric Deployment Guide

This guide describes how to deploy the **Unified Data Foundation with Fabric** solution accelerator using the **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** - the recommended deployment method.

## üöÄ Quick Start

We recommend Azure Developer CLI for the fastest deployment experience (check [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) first):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/unified-data-foundation-with-fabric-solution-accelerator.git
cd unified-data-foundation-with-fabric-solution-accelerator

# Optional: Customize the Fabric workspace name (defaults to "Unified Data Foundation with Fabric workspace")
azd env set AZURE_FABRIC_WORKSPACE_NAME "My Custom Workspace Name"

# Deploy everything with one command
azd up
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Environment name** (e.g., "dev", "test", "prod")
- **Azure region** (e.g., "eastus", "westus2")

**That's it!** `azd up` handles everything: infrastructure provisioning, Fabric workspace creation, data deployment, and admin configuration.

- Check out [deployment overview](#deployment-overview) to understand what gets created
- See alternative [deployment options](#deployment-options) for this solution accelerator
- See more [configuration options](#configuration-options) to customize your deployment
- Review the [deployment results](#deployment-results) to see what gets created

## Deployment Overview

This solution accelerator uses a two-phase deployment approach that creates a complete data foundation solution with medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold).

The deployment executes in two coordinated phases using dedicated scripts:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning** - Executes [`main.bicep`](../infra/main.bicep) to create:
   - **Microsoft Fabric Capacity**: Dedicated compute resources with configured admin permissions
   - **Resource Group**: Container for all Azure resources

2. **Fabric Workspace Setup** - Runs [`run_python_script_fabric.ps1`](../infra/scripts/utils/run_python_script_fabric.ps1) orchestrator and [`create_fabric_items.py`](../infra/scripts/fabric/create_fabric_items.py) deployment script to create:
   - **Workspace**: Organized container with folder structure for all Fabric items
   - **Lakehouses**: 3-tier medallion architecture (`maag_bronze`, `maag_silver`, `maag_gold`)
   - **Notebooks**: Data transformation and management notebooks organized by processing layer
   - **Sample Data**: Representative CSV files uploaded to bronze lakehouse for testing
   - **Power BI Reports**: Dashboard components for data visualization (if present)

The deployment orchestration coordinates both phases, passing deployment parameters and ensuring proper sequencing. See [deployment options](#deployment-options) for different ways to run this deployment based on your preferred environment.

## Deployment Options

Check the following options to choose your preferred environment for running the deployment.

| **Environment** | **Setup Required** | **Best For** |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Local Machine** | [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) installation | Development and testing |
| **Azure Cloud Shell** | azd installation during deployment | Quick deployment without local setup |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | azd installation during deployment | Collaborative development |

> **‚ö° Permission Handling**: When using Azure Developer CLI with interactive authentication, most API permissions are handled automatically. Admin consent may be required for the first deployment in an organization.

Choose your preferred environment for running `azd up`:

   curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
   
   # Reload PATH
   source ~/.bashrc
   
   # Verify installation
   azd version
   ```

6. **Authenticate with Azure:**
   ```bash
   # Login to Azure CLI
   az login --use-device-code
   
   # Login to azd (will use the same authentication)
   azd auth login --use-device-code
   ```

7. **Initialize and deploy:**
   ```bash
   # Initialize the project
   azd init
   
   # Optional: Set custom workspace name
