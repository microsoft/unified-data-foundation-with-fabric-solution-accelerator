### Key Capabilities

- **Automatic Insights**: Get AI-generated summaries and highlights from your reports
- **Visual Exploration**: Copilot can help you understand and interpret existing visualizations
- **Quick Answers**: Get instant responses to common business questions

### Prerequisites

To use Copilot for Power BI with this solution accelerator:

1. **Deployed Reports**: Complete the [Power BI Deployment Guide](./DeploymentGuidePowerBI.md) to deploy the sales dashboard
2. **Copilot Enabled**: Copilot must be enabled in your tenant admin settings
3. **(Optional) Enable Q&A on Semantic Model**: By default, Copilot answers questions based on the visuals displayed on the current report page. To query the entire semantic model beyond visible report data, see [Enable Q&A for the Semantic Model](./EnableQAForSemanticModel.md)

## Sample Questions

Here are example questions you can ask Copilot based on the visuals displayed in the report:

| Topic | Sample Question | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Revenue Trends by Year | "Show total revenue by year for last 5 years" | Yearly revenue totals to identify growth trends and year-over-year performance |
| Top Selling Products | "What is the revenue generated by Top 5 Selling products by quantity?" | Products with highest sales volume and their corresponding revenue contribution |

## Troubleshooting Copilot Responses

If Copilot is not providing useful responses, try these tips:

| Issue | Solution |
| ------- | ---------- |
| "I can't answer that" | Simplify your question. Use shorter, more direct phrases |
| Incorrect data returned | Be more specific about the measure (revenue, count, average) |
| Vague answers | Reference specific fields like "order total", "product name", or "order date" |

### Tips for Better Questions

1. **Be specific about the measure**: Instead of "show me sales", ask "what is the total order amount"
2. **Use field names from the report**: Reference visible column names like "PaymentMethod", "OrderStatus", "CategoryName"
3. **Keep it simple**: Start with basic questions before asking complex ones
4. **One question at a time**: Avoid compound questions with multiple parts
5. **Use filter terms**: "completed orders", "in 2024", "for bikes"
